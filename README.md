What you will learn from this paragraph:

*Introduction to CSS animations:*
1.Defining a keyframe animation using `@keyframes` rule named inputFocusAnimation.
2.Specifying animation steps using percentage values (0% and 100%).
3.Applying the animation to the `.member-login__input:focus` selector using the animation property.
4.Utilizing the ease-in-out timing function to control the animation's acceleration.

*Implementation of transitions:*
1.Adding a transition effect to the `.member-login__button` selector to smoothly animate the `background-color` property when hovered over.
2.Applying a transition effect to the `.member-login__input:focus ~ .member-login__label .fa-solid` selector to smoothly animate the color property when the input element is focused.
3.Defining a transition effect for the `.member-login__forgot-link:hover` and `.member-login__create-account:hover` selectors to smoothly animate the color property when hovered over.
4.Utilizing the transition property to control the duration and timing of the transitions.
